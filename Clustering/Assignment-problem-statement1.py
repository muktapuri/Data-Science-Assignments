1.Problem Statement:
Perform K means clustering on the airlines
 dataset to obtain optimum number of clusters.
 Draw the inferences from the clusters
 obtained. Refer to EastWestAirlines.xlsx
 dataset.

1.1.What is the Business Objective?
The objective is to segment customers of the
 airline based on their behavior and other
 relevant attributes using K-Means clustering.
 The goal is to identify patterns among
 different customer segments to:

     1.Improve customer retention through
     personalized offers and loyalty programs.
     2.Optimize marketing strategies by
     targeting the right customers with
     relevant campaigns.
     3.Enhance customer experience by better
     understanding diverse customer needs.
     4.Identify high-value customers for
     priority services or exclusive offerings.
     
1.2.Are there any Constraints?
Cluster Interpretability: 
    The number of clusters should be optimal
    and meaningful for business decisions.

Data Quality: 
    Requires pre-processing (handling missing
    values, scaling, etc.) for K-means to work
    effectively.

Computational Constraints: 
    Clustering large datasets could be
    resource-intensive, impacting time or
    memory.

Fixed Dataset:
    Only the EastWestAirlines.xlsx dataset is
    available, so the analysis is constrained
    by the features provided.

Cluster Size Balance:
    If clusters are unevenly distributed,
    business decisions may require careful
    adjustment.
